Hello world! I was told to add some text here.
Okay, day two of trying to learn what git is and, to be honest, I'm following allowing with the instructions but I absolutely have no clue what all these terms mean or what exactly I'm doing T^T
Wait, I think something clicked inside my thick skull. If I type [code .] on the terminal it opens VSCode and all the files inside my current repository, which is the git_test repository, because [.] means the CURRENT DIRECTORY. I am so f*cking dumb.
